	  <h2>Tools</h2>
	  
    <h3>What tools will I need?</h3>
	  
    <p>You're going to be able to write HTML, CSS and Javascript with a Mac, Chromebook, Linux or a Windows computer.  You'll need a web browser and a text editor.  These will be your main tools</p>

    <h3>Web browser</h3>   
	<p>I spend a lot of time with the Chrome browser.  Safari and Firefox are both excellent choices.  As you begin to code, you're going to be opening files localy on your computer.  Start your browser, and see if you can find File -> Open.  Can you see your local hard drive? That's all you need to know for now.  If you use a Windows browser, please consider installing Chrome or Firefox.</p>

    <h3>Text Editor</h3>
	<p>A text editor allows you to write your code.  Notepad comes with Windows and TextEdit comes with Mac OS.</p>
