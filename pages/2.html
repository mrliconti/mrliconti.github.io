	  <h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery Notes</h1>
	  
	  <h2>Tools</h2>
	  
    <h3>What tools will I need?</h3>
	  
    <p>You're going to be able to write HTML, CSS and Javascript with a Mac, Chromebook, Linux or a Windows computer.  You'll need a web browser and a text editor.  These will be your main tools</p>

    <h3>Web browser</h3>   
	<p>I spend a lot of time with the Chrome browser.  Safari and Firefox are both excellent choices.  As you begin to code, you're going to be opening files localy on your computer.  Start your browser, and see if you can find File -> Open.  Can you see your local hard drive? That's all you need to know for now.  If you use a Windows browser, please consider installing Chrome or Firefox.</p>

    <h3>Text Editor</h3>
	<p>A text editor allows you to write your code.  If you're using Linux, choices abound.  Notepad comes with Windows, TextEdit comes with Mac OS and Text can be quickly installed on a Chromebook.  They all work.  However, there are better choices.  Consider looking for a text editor that has syntax highlighting, line numbers, code folding and is free.  Read about the following when you get a chance: Sublime Text, EditPad Lite, NotePad++, Atom, Visual Studio Code.  You can see that your free choices go from fast and simple to complicated quickly.</p>	
	<p>But maybe installing applicaitons is too 20th century for you ... what about a online editor like repl.it?</p> 
	<p>All you'll need is syntax highlighting.  All your choices except Notepad will do that.</p>
	  
     <h3>Is there a better way?</h3>   
	  <p>Define 'better'.  There are 3 things that come to mind: CMS, a WYSIWYG editor and a framework.</p>
		<p>Content managment systems are awsome.  Editing a page or deploying a change across all your pages is simplified.  
		I use Google Sites for teaching and have tried WordPress for side projects.  Both have learning curves and built in flexability.  A 
		CMS allows you to get your information out there, and not have to worry too much about how it happens.  I have used 2 versions of a 
	  Microsoft product at work.  It works.</p>
	  <p>A WYSISYG editor behaves like a word processor.  You have a menu of items and a nice interface that let's you manipulate your content.
		  At one point, WYSISYG editors were stand alone products.  CMS now have this component built in.  Dreamweaver is a classic example of this 
		  type of tool.  There are others, mostly superseded by others...</p>
	  <p>Frameworks are for people who like to work with code.  There are many out there and this area is in constant development and flux.  
	  The power of the framerwork relies on the developer using or reusing code that has been bundled in the framework.</p>
