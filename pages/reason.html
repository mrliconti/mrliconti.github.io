	<h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery Notes</h1>
	  
	<h2>A Reason</h2>
	  
    <h3>You're not going to learn HTML without a reason.</h3>  
	<p>That's how learning happends.  I think it's either because necessity is the mother of invention, or because you're curious.  Either way you're going to need a project.</p>
<p>My project is this GitHub page and learning HTML (again).  You need you're own project.  Might I reccomend a few suggestions:</p>   
<ul>
  <li>a pet</li>
  <li>your pencil</li>
  <li>your shoe</li>
    </ul>
  <p>It doen't matter what you choose.  Keep the scope small.  The minute you think, I need to put up a picture of my pencil or cat or sneaker, that's when learning occurs.  And hopefully these notes go from being abstract to practical</p>
    <p>That's my intention anyway.</p>
