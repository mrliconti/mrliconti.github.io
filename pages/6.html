	<h2>Text</h2>
	  
	<h3>White space, line breaks and the horizontal rule</h3>
	  
	<p>The horizontal rule creates a visual break between your content.  It's a handy line that keeps your content from looking like a giant blob of text.  Take a look at lesson 1. Where would you have put some dividing lines?  When you figure it out, <code>&lt; hr &gt;</code> is priceless.</p>
	
	<p>The <code>&lt; hr &gt;</code> can be heavily modified with CSS.  You don't need a closing tag for <code>&lt; hr &gt;</code>.</p>

	<p>Line breaks <code>&lt; br &gt;</code> allow you to break the text flow of your text, or add space between your text blocks.  <code>&lt; br &gt;</code> doesn't need closing tags. Note in this example that I'm using the line bread <i>after</i> my text.</p>

	HTML & CSS are good for you<code>&lt; br &gt;</code><br>

	<p>White space in your source code is ignored by the browser.  
	You can hit return as often as you want, and you can add 
as many blank characters          as 
you'd like ... the browser will ignore them.  
Think of using white space 
as a way to 
make your code 
easier to read.
