	<h1>HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery Notes</h1>
	  
	<h2>Text</h2>
	  
	<h3>Strong, Emphasis, Blockquote and Quotes</h3>
	  
	<p>Strong, <code>&lt; strong &gt;</code> will be rendered like <code>&lt; b &gt;</code>.  When in doubt, remember that <code>&lt; strong &gt;</code> should be used for things like warnings, where <code>&lt; b &gt;</code> draws attention to content.</p>

	<p>Emphasis, <code>&lt; em &gt;</code> will <em>look</em> like italics.  But it shouldn't be used for that purpose.  <code>&lt; em &gt;</code> should be used when you want to <em>stress</em> a word.  If you go back to lesson 5, you'll see me make a <em>mistake</em> with the phrase 'delicate sixfold symmetry'.  In my next example, I'm not using <code>&lt; em &gt;</code> ... you may want to view source.</p>

	<p>Blockquote, <code>&lt; blockquote &gt;</code> is used for longer quotes.  It allows you to indent your text. I'm going to crib from Sloan's <cite>"Underwhelmed"</cite>:</p>

<blockquote><p>She was underwhelmed, if that's a word<br>
I know it's not, 'cause I looked it up<br>
That's one of those skills that I learned in my school<br></p>
<p>I was overwhelmed, and I'm sure of that one<br>
'cause I learned it back in grade school<br>
When I was young<br></p>
<p>She said, <i>"You is funny"</i><br>
I said, <i>"You are funny"</i><br>
She said, <i>"Thank you"</i><br>
and I said, <i>"Nevermind"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Quote, <code>&lt; q &gt;</code> is used for short quotes.  Browsers should add quotes around your text.</p>

<p>Both <code>&lt; blockquote &gt;</code> and <code>&lt; q &gt;</code> have an attribute, cite.  This allows you to indicate where the reference is coming from.  This next example comes MDN's note on <code>&lt; q &gt;</code> (View source for more details):</p>

<p>According to Mozilla's website,
  <q
  cite="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/history/details/">Firefox 1.0
  was released in 2004 and became a big success.</q></p>
